# Recommendation-days
The aim of this project is to know when the customer is going to buy in an online retail environment.
The data used had transactional data of online retail which consisted of product name, transaction date,transaction id,price,etc.
Basis this, I have tried to use K-means algorithm to cluster the customers based on its RFM score(Recency,Frequency,Monetary Value)
Further, have created additional columns to get the no.of days between the purchases for a customer so as to determine when the customer is going to buy next.
In online retail i.e. in ecommerce it becomes imperative to know this, because according to this the online retailer can decide on the effective promotional strategies.
